# frontdoor_criterion
This repository hosts all the code related to my master seminar thesis on the frontdoor criterion (FDC) and its potential applications.

Generally this repository is divided into sections.
- **01_simulations**: hosts R scripts that challenge the FDC using simulated data
- **02_taxi**: hosts R scripts for the replication of the analysis of one of the only empirical applications of the FDC by Bellemare et al. (2020)
